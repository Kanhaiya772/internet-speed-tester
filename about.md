# About Internet Speed Indicator

The **Internet Speed Indicator** project was created to offer users a simple and effective way to measure their internet speed through a web interface. This project integrates with the `speedtest-cli` library, which communicates with Speedtest servers to perform the tests.

## Key Points

- **Objective:** To provide an intuitive and visually appealing application that displays download speed, upload speed, and ping.
- **Motivation:** Many users want to check their internet performance without navigating to dedicated speed test websites, so having this app hosted locally or publicly makes it easier and faster.
- **Technology Choice:** i chose Python FastAPI for the backend due to its simplicity and speed, and for the frontend, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for easy customization and responsiveness.
- **Future Improvements:**
    - Add the option to save and compare historical speed test results.
    - Provide more detailed information about the server used for the test.
    - Enhance the UI with animations and custom themes.
